# Arithmetic-SENG560_2

Use this library to perform arithmetic functions on various data types. For octals, prefix an integer with a "0".

To add a new arithmetic function to this library:
- add a new method to the ArithmeticExecutor for new data types
- update calculation methods in classes that implement the ArithmeticExecutor interface
- add new methods to the Arithmetic class
